I am a theoretical physics doctoral student working in the group of Hans Briegel at the University of Innsbruck. My research experience is based mostly in general relativity, reinforcement learning, quantum chemistry, and scientific computing. My research interests currently reside primarily in the overlap between quantum foundations and information, artificial intelligence, and quantum gravity. I am particularly interested in developing quantum machine learning in relativistic settings and exploring the relationship between agency and spacetime structure. My most recent work has been in classical machine learning where my collaborators and I further developed an explainable model and introduced a quantum-inspired inductive bias to aid learning.

I also place a strong emphasis on good scientific communication and education (which is always a work in progress for me). Additionally, I am interested in the effective altruism movement, which is a network of people dedicated to helping others and giving effectively through evidence-based research.
