  abstract ={Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of nonlocal entanglement and magic and is an equivalent notion of nonclassicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced, and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems and that there are regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general measures for any form of harvested contextuality, including nonlocal entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.}

  abstract={A mapping is made between fermion exchange and excluded volume in the quantum-classical isomorphism using polymer self-consistent field theory. Apart from exchange, quantum particles are known to be exactly representable in classical statistical mechanics as ring polymers, with contours that are parametrized by the inverse thermal energy, often called the imaginary time. Evidence in support of a previously used approximation for fermion exchange in ring polymer self-consistent field theory is given, specifically, that the use of all-contour interactions in the mean field picture instead of equal imaginary time interactions is justified based on the symmetry of ring polymers. It is also shown that the removal of forbidden thermal trajectories, both those that violate excluded volume directly and those that represent topologically inaccessible microstates, is equivalent to antisymmetric exchange. The electron density of the beryllium atom is calculated with ring polymer self-consistent field theory ignoring classical correlations, and very good agreement is found with Hartree-Fock theory which also neglects Coulomb correlations. The total binding energies agree to within less than 6%, which, while still far from chemical accuracy, is remarkable given that the field theory equations are derived from first principles with zero free parameters. The discrepancy between self-consistent field theory and Hartree-Fock theory is attributed to classical Coulomb self-interactions which are included in Hartree-Fock theory but not in self-consistent field theory. A potential method to improve the agreement by more accurately representing electron-electron self-interactions in self-consistent field theory is discussed, as are the implications for quantum foundations of the quantum-classical mapping between fermion exchange and thermal trajectory excluded volume.}

  abstract={An alternative approach to density functional theory based on self-consistent field theory for ring polymers is applied to neutral atoms hydrogen to neon in their ground-states. The spontaneous emergence of an atomic shell structure and spherical symmetry-breaking of the total electron density are predicted by the model using the ideas of polymer excluded-volume between pairs of electrons to enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle and an exact electron self-interaction correction. The Pauli potential is approximated by neglecting inter-atomic correlations along with other types of correlations, and comparisons to Hartree–Fock theory are made, which also ignores correlations. The model shows excellent agreement with Hartree–Fock theory to within the standards of orbital-free density functional theory for the atomic binding energies and density profiles of the first six elements, providing exact matches for the elements hydrogen and helium. The predicted shell structure starts to deviate significantly past the element neon, and spherical symmetry-breaking is first predicted to occur at carbon instead of boron. The self-consistent field theory energy functional that describes the model is decomposed into thermodynamic components to trace the origin of spherical symmetry-breaking. It is found to arise from the electron density approaching closer to the nucleus in non-spherical distributions, which lowers the energy despite resulting in frustration between the quantum kinetic energy, electron–electron interaction, and the Pauli exclusion interaction. The symmetry-breaking effect is found to have a minimal impact on the binding energies, which suggests that the spherical-averaging approximation used in previous work is physically reasonable when investigating atomic systems. The pair density contour plots display behavior similar to polymer macro-phase separation, where individual electron pairs occupy single lobe structures that together form a dumbbell shape analogous to the 2p orbital shape. It is further shown that the predicted densities satisfy known constraints and produce the same total electronic density profile that is predicted by other formulations of quantum mechanics.}

  abstract={With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However, most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature that makes it difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits, including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (MEPS), a generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward to describe the agent’s training history along with applications to AI and hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is formalized for our classical MEPS framework and employed to tackle the exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on the number of particles that can interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy model environments and a more complex scenario that models the diagnosis of a broken computer. These environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice of the inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum model for MEPS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are discussed.}

  abstract={A representation of polymer self-consistent field theory equivalent to quantum density functional theory is given in terms of non-orthogonal basis sets. Molecular integrals and self-consistent equations for spherically symmetric systems using Gaussian basis functions are given, and the binding energies and radial electron densities of neutral atoms hydrogen through krypton are calculated. An exact electron self-interaction correction is adopted and the Pauli-exclusion principle is enforced through ideas of polymer excluded-volume. The atoms hydrogen through neon are examined without some approximations which permit cancellation of errors and spontaneous shell structure is observed. Correlations are neglected in the interest of simplicity and comparisons are made with Hartree–Fock theory. The implications of the Pauli-exclusion potential and its approximate form are discussed, and the Pauli model is analyzed using scaling theory for the uniform electron density case where the correct form of the Thomas–Fermi quantum kinetic energy and the Dirac exchange correction are recovered.}

  abstract={We present an explicit construction of a relativistic quantum computing architecture using a variational quantum circuit approach that is shown to allow for universal quantum computing. The variational quantum circuit consists of tunable single-qubit rotations and entangling gates that are implemented successively. The single-qubit rotations are parameterized by the proper time intervals of the qubits’ trajectories and can be tuned by varying their relativistic motion in spacetime. The entangling layer is mediated by a relativistic quantum field instead of through direct coupling between the qubits. Within this setting, we give a prescription for how to use quantum field-mediated entanglement and manipulation of the relativistic motion of qubits to obtain a universal gate set, for which compact nonperturbative expressions that are valid for general spacetimes are also obtained. We also derive a lower bound on the channel fidelity that shows the existence of parameter regimes in which all entangling operations are effectively unitary, despite the noise generated from the presence of a mediating quantum field. Finally, we consider an explicit implementation of the quantum Fourier transform with relativistic qubits.}

  abstract={We consider thin spherical shells of matter in both Newtonian gravity and general relativity and examine their equilibrium configurations and dynamical stability. Thin-shell models are admittedly a poor substitute for realistic stellar models. But the simplicity of the equations that govern their dynamics, compared to the much more complicated mechanics of a self-gravitating fluid, allows us to deliver, in a very direct and easy manner, powerful insights into their equilibria and stability. We explore, in particular, the link between the existence of a maximum mass along a sequence of equilibrium configurations and the onset of dynamical instability. Such a link is well-established in the case of fluid bodies in both Newtonian gravity and general relativity, but the demonstration of this link is both subtle and difficult. The proof is very simple, however, in the case of thin shells, and it is constructed with nothing more than straightforward algebra and a little calculus.}
